Q1. What is the difference between a regular function and an arrow function?

A. 
Regular Function is defined using the function keyword.
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

Arrow Function is defined using the => syntax.
const add = (a, b) => a + b;


Q2. What is a React Component?

A. A React component is a small, reusable code, which is responsible for one part of the application UI. A React application is an aggregation of components.
In React we assemble different components together to create an application. We use JavaScript functions or classes to make components.
Components are reusable pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled independently. They help in breaking down the UI into smaller, manageable parts.
If we use a function, the component will be a functional component, but if we use a class, the component will be a class-based component.


Q3. How do you make a React functional component?

A. You can make a React functional component by defining a JavaScript function that returns React elements, eg:

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
}

or

const Header = () => (
  <header>
    <div className='header-wrapper'>
      <h1>Welcome to 30 Days Of React</h1>
      <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
      <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
    </div>
  </header>
)


Q4. What is the difference between a pure JavaScript function and a functional component?

A. 
Pure JavaScript Function: A standalone block of code designed to perform a specific task. It takes input (parameters) and returns an output, with no side effects or dependencies on external states.
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

React Functional Component: A special kind of function that returns React elements (JSX) and is used to define a part of the UI. Unlike pure functions, it can use hooks to manage state and side effects.

In essence, while both are functions, a React functional component is specifically designed to handle UI logic and rendering within the React framework, leveraging hooks for state and lifecycle management.

Q5. How small is a React component?

A. A component that returns only a single HTML as JSX is considered as a small component, eg, a button component or an alert box component, or just an input field component.

const Button = () => <button>action</button>
The Button component is made of a single HTML button element.

Q6. Can we make a button or input field component?

A.
const Button = () => <button>action</button>

const InputField = () => <input type="text" />
