Q1. What is React?

A. React is a JavaScript library for building a reusable user interface(UI). React is used to build single page applications (an application which has only one HTML page).
When we work with React we do not interact directly with the DOM. React has its own way to handle the DOM manipulation. React uses its virtual DOM to make new changes and it updates only the element, that needs changing. We use react to make reusable UI components of a website.
Some key featues of React are:
    -> Component-Based: React allows you to build complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called components.

    -> Declarative: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by managing the state of your application and efficiently updating and rendering the right components when your data changes.

    -> Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. Instead of manipulating the real DOM directly, React creates a virtual representation of it and then updates the real DOM only where changes have occurred.

    -> Unidirectional Data Flow: React enforces a one-way data flow, which makes it easier to debug and understand how data changes in your application.


Q2. What is a library?

A. In the context of programming, a library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks without having to write the code from scratch. Libraries provide functions, classes, and routines to simplify and accelerate the development process. They are designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into various projects to enhance functionality and efficiency.
Libraries help developers save time and effort by offering pre-built solutions to common problems.

Q3. What is a single page application?

A. A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without requiring a full page reload. This approach provides a more seamless and responsive user experience, similar to that of a desktop application. SPAs typically use frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to manage the user interface and handle navigation and data fetching behind the scenes.

Q4. What is a component?

A. A component is a self-contained, reusable piece of code that encapsulates specific functionality or logic. In frameworks like React, components are the building blocks used to construct the user interface. Each component can manage its own state and lifecycle methods, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive applications. Components can range from simple elements, like buttons or input fields, to complex structures, like entire forms or navigation menus. Their modular nature makes it easy to develop, maintain, and scale applications.

Q5. What is the latest version of React?

A. The latest version of React is **React 19**, which was officially released on April 25, 2024. This version brings several new features and improvements designed to enhance the developer experience and application performance.

Q6. What is DOM?

A. DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface provided by web browsers that allows scripts to update the content, structure, and style of a document while it is being displayed. Essentially, the DOM represents the HTML or XML documents as a tree structure where each node corresponds to a part of the document (like elements, attributes, and text). This hierarchical structure enables developers to easily navigate and manipulate the document's structure.

Q7. What is React Virtual DOM?

A. The React Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. When a component's state or props change, React updates the virtual DOM first instead of making changes directly to the real DOM. It then compares the new virtual DOM with the previous version (a process called "diffing") to identify what has changed. React then updates only those parts of the real DOM that have changed, resulting in faster and more efficient updates. This process minimizes the number of direct manipulations needed to the actual DOM, enhancing the overall performance and user experience of the application.
An in-memory representation refers to how data structures, like objects or DOM elements, are stored and manipulated directly in the computer's RAM rather than being stored on disk or in a database. This means the data is readily accessible and can be quickly modified or read by the program. In the context of the React Virtual DOM, an in-memory representation means that React keeps a copy of the DOM elements in the computer's memory. This copy allows React to make changes and calculations very rapidly without directly interacting with the slower, real DOM. Once the updates are determined, only the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM, resulting in faster performance and a more responsive user experience.

Q8. What does a web application /website have/is composed of?

A. A web application or a website is composed of several key components that work together to provide a seamless user experience. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Frontend (Client-Side)**:
   - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The skeleton of the web page, defining its structure and content.
   - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: The styling layer, responsible for the visual presentation, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
   - **JavaScript**: The scripting language used to create interactive and dynamic features, such as animations, form validations, and asynchronous data loading.

2. **Backend (Server-Side)**:
   - **Server**: Handles requests from the client, processes data, and sends responses back. Common server-side languages include Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java.
   - **Database**: Stores and manages data for the web application. Examples include SQL databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).
   - **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: Facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, allowing data to be exchanged securely and efficiently.

3. **Hosting and Infrastructure**:
   - **Web Server**: Hosts the web application and delivers content to users over the internet. Examples include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.
   - **Cloud Services**: Platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide scalable infrastructure, storage, and other services required to run web applications.

4. **Security**:
   - **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Encrypt data transmitted between the client and server to ensure secure communication.
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Mechanisms to verify user identity and control access to different parts of the application.

5. **Version Control and Deployment**:
   - **Version Control Systems**: Tools like Git help manage code changes and collaborate with other developers.
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automates the process of testing, building, and deploying applications to ensure rapid and reliable releases.

These components work together to create a functional, efficient, and secure web application or website, delivering content and services to users across the globe.

Q9. Why did you chose to use react?

A. React offers several advantages that make it a popular choice for building web applications:

    1. **Component-Based Architecture**: React's component-based structure allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state. This modularity makes it easier to maintain and reuse code.

    2. **Virtual DOM**: React's use of a virtual DOM improves performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the real DOM. It updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, resulting in faster and more efficient rendering.

    3. **Declarative Syntax**: With React, you describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React efficiently updates and renders the components when the data changes. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.

    4. **Strong Community and Ecosystem**: React has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries available. This ecosystem can significantly speed up development and problem-solving.

    5. **Cross-Platform Development**: React Native, a framework based on React, allows developers to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android using the same principles and codebase. This provides a unified development experience across web and mobile platforms.

    6. **SEO-Friendly**: React can be rendered on the server-side, which improves the performance and search engine optimization (SEO) of your web application. This is particularly important for web apps that need to be indexed by search engines.

    7. **Flexibility**: React can be used with a variety of other libraries and frameworks, allowing developers to choose the best tools for their specific project needs. It also supports the latest JavaScript features, making it a future-proof choice.

These advantages make React a powerful and flexible tool for developing modern, high-performance web applications.

Q10. What measures do you use to know popularity (of a framework)?
