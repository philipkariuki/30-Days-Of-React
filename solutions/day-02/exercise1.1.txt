Q1. What is React?

A. React is a JavaScript library for building a reusable user interface(UI). React is used to build single page applications (an application which has only one HTML page).
When we work with React we do not interact directly with the DOM. React has its own way to handle the DOM manipulation. React uses its virtual DOM to make new changes and it updates only the element, that needs changing. We use react to make reusable UI components of a website.
Some key featues of React are:
    -> Component-Based: React allows you to build complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called components.

    -> Declarative: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by managing the state of your application and efficiently updating and rendering the right components when your data changes.

    -> Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. Instead of manipulating the real DOM directly, React creates a virtual representation of it and then updates the real DOM only where changes have occurred.

    -> Unidirectional Data Flow: React enforces a one-way data flow, which makes it easier to debug and understand how data changes in your application.


Q2. What is a library?

A. In the context of programming, a library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks without having to write the code from scratch. Libraries provide functions, classes, and routines to simplify and accelerate the development process. They are designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into various projects to enhance functionality and efficiency.
Libraries help developers save time and effort by offering pre-built solutions to common problems.

Q3. What is a single page application?

A. A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without requiring a full page reload. This approach provides a more seamless and responsive user experience, similar to that of a desktop application. SPAs typically use frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to manage the user interface and handle navigation and data fetching behind the scenes.

Q4. What is a component?

A. A component is a self-contained, reusable piece of code that encapsulates specific functionality or logic. In frameworks like React, components are the building blocks used to construct the user interface. Each component can manage its own state and lifecycle methods, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive applications. Components can range from simple elements, like buttons or input fields, to complex structures, like entire forms or navigation menus. Their modular nature makes it easy to develop, maintain, and scale applications.

Q5. What is the latest version of React?

A. The latest version of React is **React 19**, which was officially released on April 25, 2024. This version brings several new features and improvements designed to enhance the developer experience and application performance.
