Mapping arrays

An array is the most frequently used data structure to handle many kinds of problems. In React, we use map to modify an array to a list of JSX by adding certain HTML elements to each element of an array.

Mapping and rendering arrays:
Most of the time data is in the form of an array or an array of objects. To render this array or array of objects, most of the time we modify the data using *map*.
In the previous section, we rendered the techs list using map method. In this section, we will see more examples.

In the following examples, we will see how we render an array of numbers, an array of strings, an array of countries and an array of skills on the browser.
